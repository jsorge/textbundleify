# textbundleify

This package will take a directory of markdown files and turn them into [textbundle](http://textbundle.org)s.

An option argument can be passed in, which is a directory of images (or a directory of directories of images â€“ it works recursively).

# Usage

Clone the repo and run `swift build`, and call the outputted binary from a directory containing Markdown files.
